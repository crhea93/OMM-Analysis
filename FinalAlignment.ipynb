    "# Final Alignment\n",

    "\n",
    "When this happens, we need to manually align any images that failed to get sky coordinates. I prefer to make the mosaic (using mosaic.py) with the images that astronet could solve for. Then, we need to find a bright source that is in both the mosaic and the image that is missing coordinates. We use this source to align the un-solved image and apply WCS to it :) The coordinates should be in physical or image units (in all the examples that I have done, they are identical)."
